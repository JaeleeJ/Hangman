# Hangman
# Overview

<!-- {Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->

<!-- {Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Rust language.} -->
I created a command line hangman game where the user guesses the word. I also completed a stretch challenge to implement object oriented programming into the program.

<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->
The purpose of this code is to have fun guessing words through a hangman game. 

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.} -->

# Development Environment

<!-- {Describe the tools that you used to develop the software} -->
I used a few tutorials to help me setup Rust and code a hangman game.

<!-- {Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.} -->
I used Rust along with Cargo to create my game. I also imported random and standard libraries.

# Future Work

<!-- {Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.} -->

- Next time, I would add the hangman pictures. In the command line, I tried to add them, but it looked messy and did not work perfectly.
- I would also add more word options to the game. I only came up with 10 words, so a list of 50 would have more options if one wanted to play multiple times.
- In the future, I could have the program read from a file of words to make the code neater.
